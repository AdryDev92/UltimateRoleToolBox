# Contributing to the project

## If you want help

1. Create an `issue` with the correct label to communicate about what we must put attention.
2. If you can improve a feature, `fork` this repo and start a `pull request` to propose the changes.

## Don't be impatient

If you start an issue for example, don't be impatient if the owner doesn't answer you in some days. He has more projects and his own life.

## Test the code

The easiest way to help with the project is fork the repo, test and clean the code of each feature.
Once done, you must open a new `pull request` with the code, describing all changes, and if all is OK, we'll approve the pull request and we'll merge it.

## Extra info
This repo is made in english for the internacionalization, but **I'm spanish**, so you can talk me in english and spanish (^^)
